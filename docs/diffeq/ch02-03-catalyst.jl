# Catalyst.jl

`Catalyst.jl` is a domain specific language (DSL) for high performance simulation and modeling of chemical reaction networks. `Catalyst.jl` is based on `ModelingToolkit.jl` for symbolic transformations.

This part is lalrgely based on [Catalyst.jl Docs](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/dev/).

## Repressilator example

Take the [Repressilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressilator) for example:

end

states(repressilator)

# Parameters in the reaction network
parameters(repressilator)

# Reactions in the reaction network
reactions(repressilator)

# ### Convert a reaction network to an ODE system
odesys = convert(ODESystem, repressilator)

# To setup parameters (`ps`) and initial conditions (`u₀`), you can use symbols to specify the values.
p = [:α => .5, :K => 40, :n => 2, :δ => log(2)/120, :γ => 5e-3, :β => 20*log(2)/120, :μ => log(2)/60]
u₀ = [:m₁ => 0., :m₂ => 0., :m₃ => 0., :P₁ => 20.,:P₂ => 0.,:P₃ => 0.]

# Or you can extract MTK symbols with the `@unpack` macro (recommended, since it's less error-prone)
@unpack m₁, m₂, m₃, P₁, P₂, P₃, α, K, n, δ, γ, β, μ = repressilator
p = [α => .5, K => 40, n => 2, δ => log(2)/120, γ => 5e-3, β => 20*log(2)/120, μ => log(2)/60]
u₀ = [m₁ => 0., m₂ => 0., m₃ => 0., P₁ => 20., P₂ => 0., P₃ => 0.]

# Then we can solve this ODE problem

# Use extracted symbols to make a phase plot.
fig = plot(sol, idxs = (P₁, P₂));

# ### Convert to Stochastic simulations
# You can create a stochastic model from the very same reaction network.
# The initial conditions should be integers

u₀ = [m₁ => 0, m₂ => 0, m₃ => 0, P₁ => 20, P₂ => 0, P₃ => 0]

# Create a discrete problem because our species are integer valued:
dprob = DiscreteProblem(repressilator, u₀, tspan, p)

# Create a `JumpProblem`, and specify Gillespie's Direct Method as the solver.
jprob = JumpProblem(repressilator, dprob, Direct(), save_positions=(false,false))

# Solve and visualize the problem.

## Chemical Langevin Equation (CLE) Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) Models

Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) Models are in the middle ground of deterministic ODE model and Gillispie stochastic models, by introducing noise terms into the differential equations system.

Take the birth-death process as example:
"""

bdp = @reaction_network begin
    c₁, X --> 2X
    c₂, X --> 0
    c₃, 0 --> X
end

#---
@unpack c₁, c₂, c₃, X = bdp
p = (c₁ => 1.0, c₂ => 2.0, c₃ => 50.)
u₀ = [X => 5.]
tspan = (0., 4.)
sprob = SDEProblem(bdp, u₀, tspan, p)

# solve and plot, `tstops` is used to specify enough points that the plot looks well-resolved.
sol = solve(sprob, LambaEM(), tstops=range(0., step=4e-3, length=1001))
fig = plot(sol);

## Generating Reaction Systems Programmatically

There are two ways to create a reaction for `ReactionSystem`s:
- `Reaction()` function
- `@reaction` macro
"""

@parameters α K n δ γ β μ
@variables t
@species m₁(t) m₂(t) m₃(t) P₁(t) P₂(t) P₃(t)

### Reaction function

The `Reaction(rate, substrates, products)` function builds reactions. To allow for other stoichiometric coefficients we also provide a five argument form: `Reaction(rate, substrates, products, substrate_stoichiometries, product_stoichiometries)`

# We can use conservation laws to eliminiate some state variables. For example, in the chemical reaction `A + B <--> C`, given the initial concentrations of A, B, and C, the solver only needs to solve one state variable (either [A], [B], or [C]) instead of all three of them.
